# Introduce

I created this repository for sharing my programming homework of machine learning course(Ng, Stanford). You can browse it by this [website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). I think this course is very significant and educational for machine learning rookies. Considering not skillful  with Matlab, If you find some bugs in my code, do not hesitate to send email to me. I will appreciate it very much.


# ex1 Linear Regression with Multiple Variables

I have worked out all the programming tasks(including optional tasks) of week 2 and the results returned from Stanford  shows that they are all right. 

# ex2 Logistic Regression

All examples test well(nice work) after submiting.

# ex3 Nerual Networks:Representation

All examples test well(nice work)

# ex4 Neural Networks:Learning

All examples test well(nice work)

# ex5 Advice for applying machine learning & machine leanring system design

All examples test well. 

Need to notice, training error doesnot include the regularization term. You should compute the training error and validation error by setting lambda equals 0 in the validationCurve.m

# ex6 Support Vector Machines

All examples test well.

# ex7 unsupervised learning
All files test well.
PCA for face recognition is very funny. It need more mathmatic methods to provides them.



#  Licensing

No complex licenses. Do anything you want.
