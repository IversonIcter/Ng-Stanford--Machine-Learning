# Introduce

I created this repository for sharing my programming homework of machine learning course(Ng, Stanford). You can browse it by this [website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). I think this course is very significant and educational for machine learning rookies. Considering not skillful  with Matlab, If you find some bugs in my code, don't hesitate to send email to me. I will appreciate it very much.

#  Week 2

I have worked out all the programming tasks(including optional tasks) of week 2 and the results returned from Stanford  shows that they are all right. 

# Week 3

All examples test well(nice work) after submiting.
